# Angular Testing Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Install the Cypress for E2E testing & Compoenents Testing : 

Run `ng add @cypress/schematic` to install and configure the Angular Cypress project.

You can run the E2E test using two way : 

- `npx cypress run` – Non-interactive test runner. Runs the tests in a “headless” browser. This means the browser window is not visible.
- `npx cypress open` - Opens a window where you can select which browser to use and which tests to run. The browser window is visible and it remains visible after completion.
